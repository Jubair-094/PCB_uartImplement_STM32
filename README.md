# PCB_uartImplement_STM32

folder uart:

1. Here, Kicad files are given. "uart.kicad_sch". This file contains a schematic. Directly opening 
  it will open the schematic editor
  
2."uart.kicad_pcb" contains the layout design. Here, all the routing is implemented. This is a 
  2-layer PCB, and by going to 3d view, can see the physical view of the PCB

folder GerberFile:

This folder contains the information related to printing the PCB. Zip the GerberFile and can upload to the website (like 'PCBWay') to print the UART PCB board
