# PCB_uartImplement_STM32

folder uart:
1.Here kicad files are given. "uart.kicad_sch" this file contains schematic file. Directly opening 
  it will open schematic editor
2."uart.kicad_pcb" contains the layout design. here all the routing are implemented. This is a 
  2 layer pcb and by going to 3d view can see the physical view of the pcb

folder GerberFile:
This folder contains the information related to printing the pcb. zip the GerberFile and can upload to the website (like 'PCBWay') to print the uart pcb board
